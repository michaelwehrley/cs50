// Write, in a file called initials.c, a program that prompts a user for their name (using GetString to obtain their name as a string) and then outputs their initials in uppercase with no spaces or periods, followed by a newline (\n) and nothing more. You may assume that the user’s input will contain only letters (uppercase and/or lowercase) plus single spaces between words. Folks like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Conan O’Brien, and David J. Malan won’t be using your program.

// So that we can automate some tests of your code, your program must behave per the examples below. Assumed that the underlined text is what some user has typed.
